## What is FoodWise ðŸ¤”
Foodwise is a mobile application designed to address the critical issue of household food waste in Indonesia, where research by the United Nations Statistics Division in 2019 highlighted a per capita waste of 121 kilograms, with 77 kilograms generated by households. Our app serves as a virtual food storage system, enabling users to track their food consumption by monitoring items in stock, consumed, and expired. It features a machine learning model to recommend recipes based on current inventory and a TensorFlow Lite model to detect food freshness using the deviceâ€™s camera. By promoting responsible consumption and providing actionable insights, Foodwise aims to empower households to minimize food waste, contributing to a more sustainable future. Our development plan includes comprehensive backend and frontend development, integration of advanced ML and TensorFlow Lite models, thorough testing, mobile platform deployment, and ongoing support and monitoring post-launch.
